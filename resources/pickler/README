Pickling scripts here can be ugly. Elim was not asked to make
the pickling scripts, but she keeps the scripts here just in
case they are needed in the future. 

Better structures (such as making a `pickler` class to reduce
the redundancy of the same codes in multiple scripts) can be,
but is not, done. 

Elim apologies for the messiness in the pickling tools, and
she tries to leave as many useful comments as she can along
the way.

To run scripts in this folder, use the following enviornment

$ eval `/cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org/py2-v2/setup.sh`
$ bash /data/user/elims/software/greco_software/debug/env-shell.sh
